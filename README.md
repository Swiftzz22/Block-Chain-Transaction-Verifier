# Software Project

This repository contains a software project developed as part of my academic work.
It demonstrates problem-solving and end-to-end implementation.

## Technologies Used
- C 

## Description
The software project I am most proud of is the blockchain transaction verification system I built as part of my Operating Systems coursework. The project involved developing a POSIX-compliant C program that validated blockchain transactions using shared memory, message queues, and efficient file handling. I implemented mechanisms for encrypted wallet ID handling, suspicious transaction detection, and inter-process communication with a helper process.

What makes this project meaningful to me is that it required a deep understanding of low-level system concepts and careful attention to correctness, synchronization, and performance. Debugging failing test cases and optimizing the solution strengthened my grasp of operating systems internals and gave me confidence in writing robust, production-style systems code.
